# Project Overview

The main objective of the BucketList E-Commerce website is to provide a user-friendly platform for people to search for an adventure that suits them and to be able to purchase the advenutre securely. The target end user is anyone and everyone who is interested in an adventure, and who has a desire to travel and explore new places.

The e-commerce store has functionality that allows the user to add an adventure into a checkout bag, post testimonials, add adventures to a wishlist to save for later, contact us directly for any enquiries. This access thereby permits the user to interact with the forum platform and take part in discussions. End users are able to: 

	- Add a adventure to the checkout bag.
	- Update their checkout bag.
	- Purchase a product through stripe payment.
	- Create, Read, Update and Delete testimonial posts.
    - Add or remove an adventure from their wishlist.

Additionally, users have access to their profile, which gives them there order history and the ability to save billing information to allow smooth purchases. 

When users decide to create a post, they are prompted to provide a unique title of their choosing, their post content, and an excerpt to contextualise their post.

Once the post has been created, it will published on the forum. Once the post is published, the user will be able to see them on the main post list page. From there the user will be able to edit and delete their posts.

BucketList is a Django framework app. The user's post data is stored in a database with PostgreSql, and the app is hosted on Heroku. The Django administration site was utilised to provide admin control in order to monitor forum content, as well as super user control of CRUD operations - including the ability to delete other usersâ€™ posts and comments.

Below is the link to the live website:
